Doesn't ask any questions.\n\n## Configuration options\n\nYou can use the `the-closer.closeWindowTogetherWithLastTab` [configuration option](https://atom.io/docs/latest/customizing-atom#advanced-configuration) to configure whether the window is closed with or after the last tab is closed:\n\n```coffee\n# config.cson\n\n'the-closer':\n  'closeWindowTogetherWithLastTab': true\n```\n\nYou can also configure this option in _Atom > Preferences > Close After Last Tab_.\n\nIf `closeWindowTogetherWithLastTab` is set to `false`, then the current window will be closed when `core:close` is triggered (e.g. with `cmd-w`) after the last tab has been closed. In other words, you need to press `cmd-w` again after the last tab has been closed.\n\nIf `closeWindowTogetherWithLastTab` is set to `true`, then the current window will be close when `core:close` is triggered to close the last tab. In other words, pressing `cmd-w` to close the last tab will also close the window.\n\nBy default, `closeWindowTogetherWithLastTab` is set to `true`.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"the-closer@0.6.0","_shasum":"69253dff63e2f954505ec70877bc0f41073e1cc3","_resolved":"file:../d-115109-3678-1wdfs30/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115109-3678-1wdfs30/package.tgz"}
